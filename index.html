        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Ibrahim, and this is a summary of the classes I’ve taken during my three years of high school. Each year has helped me learn more about computers, technology, and how things work behind the scenes.
        <br> Each of these classes taught me something different and helped me figure out that I want to go into cybersecurity in the future. Now I’ll show you more about what I did each year.
        </p>
    
        <div class="section">
          <h2>Freshman Year</h2>
          <p>Java Programming:
This was my first real coding class. I learned Java, which is a programming language used in a lot of apps, websites, and games. I learned the basics like:
     <ol>
<li>How to print messages on the screen</li>
<li>How to use variables to store numbers or words</li>
<li>How to make decisions using if and else</li>
<li>How to repeat tasks using loops</li>                 
     </ol>
    
Engineering with OnShape:
In this class, I used a tool called OnShape, which lets you build 3D models of objects. It was kind of like building things in Minecraft but more technical. I learned how to:
             
            <ol>
<li>Sketch shapes and turn them into 3D parts</li>
<li>Cut and join pieces together</li>
<li>Make full designs of things like tools and parts</li>
<li>This class helped me understand how real engineers design machines, buildings, and products. It taught me how to think in 3D and pay attention to small details.</li>
                   <ol>
          </p>
                   </div>


          
        <div class="section">
          <h2>Sophomore Year</h2>
          <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
In my second year, I went deeper into coding. I learned Object-Oriented Programming, which is a way to write code that’s more organized and easier to fix or reuse.
I learned how to:             
    <ol>
<li>Make classes, which are like blueprints for objects</li>
<li>Create objects that can do things and hold data</li>
<li>Use inheritance, where one class can take things from another</li>
<li>Keep parts of code private or public to protect it</li>
    </ol>
</p>
 </div>
    
        <div class="section">
          <h2>Junior Year</h2>
          <p>Web Design:
In this class, I learned how websites are built from scratch. I used HTML to add content like text, images, and links, and CSS to style everything with colors, fonts, and layouts.
Some of the things I learned:
              <ol>
<li>How to make menus and sections with div tags</li>
<li>How to use Flexbox and Grid to line things up on the pages</li>
<li>How to change styles when someone hovers over a button</li>
<li>How to make websites look good on phones and computers</li> 
              </ol>
              
I really enjoyed designing pages and seeing how my ideas came to life on the screen.
<br>
              
              Cybersecurity:
This was one of my favorite classes. I learned how to protect computers and networks from hackers and viruses.
We learned about:
              <ol>
<li>Different types of cyber attacks like phishing and malware</li>
<li>Password safety and how hackers guess passwords</li>
<li>How firewalls and antivirus software protect systems</li>
<li>Ethical hacking (using hacking skills to protect, not harm) </li>  
              </ol>

I also learned some basic Linux commands and how to use virtual machines. This class made me realize I want to go into cybersecurity as a career. It felt like solving mysteries and stopping bad guys online.
