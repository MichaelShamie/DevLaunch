        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Ibrahim, and this is a summary of the classes I’ve taken during my three years of high school. Each year has helped me learn more about computers, technology, and how things work behind the scenes.
        <br> Each of these classes taught me something different and helped me figure out that I want to go into cybersecurity in the future. Now I’ll show you more about what I did each year.
        </p>
    
        <div class="section">
          <h2>Freshman Year</h2>
          <p>Java Programming:
This was my first real coding class. I learned Java, which is a programming language used in a lot of apps, websites, and games. I learned the basics like:
              <li>
                  
                  <ol>
How to print messages on the screen
How to use variables to store numbers or words
How to make decisions using if and else
How to repeat tasks using loops
                  </ol>
</li>
    
Engineering with OnShape:
In this class, I used a tool called OnShape, which lets you build 3D models of objects. It was kind of like building things in Minecraft but more technical. I learned how to:
              <li>
                  <ol>
Sketch shapes and turn them into 3D parts
Cut and join pieces together
Make full designs of things like tools and parts
This class helped me understand how real engineers design machines, buildings, and products. It taught me how to think in 3D and pay attention to small details.
                  </ol>
              </li>
          </p>
        </div>


          
        <div class="section">
          <h2>Sophomore Year</h2>
          <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
In my second year, I went deeper into coding. I learned Object-Oriented Programming, which is a way to write code that’s more organized and easier to fix or reuse.
I learned how to:             
<li>
    <ol>
Make classes, which are like blueprints for objects
Create objects that can do things and hold data
Use inheritance, where one class can take things from another
Keep parts of code private or public to protect it
    </ol>
</li>
</p>
 </div>
    
        <div class="section">
          <h2>Junior Year</h2>
          <p>This year, I studied Web Design, where I learned HTML, CSS, and design principles to create modern websites. I also took a Cybersecurity course, learning about digital threats, network security, encryption, and how to protect systems from attacks.</p>
